# MEMS IMU Subsystem
*Electronics and Telemetry Team*

**Members**: Catherine Phillips, Kaanthi Pandhigunta, Ruth Muelller, and Nico Espinosa Dice

**Responsibilities**: Fuse accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers to determine orientation and position of rocket in space. Includes circuit development, algorithm development and filtering.

## Folders

### Datasets ###
Contains dataset created using the Structures/Aerodynamic team's Matlab script to simulate rocket's flight. Another dataset has added Gaussian noise to the simulated data.

### Sensor Fusion - Orientation ###
Contains our sensor fusion algorithm (implemented in Python, not finished) for determining orientation, as well as a link to the paper whose algorithm we are using.

### Kalman Filter - Python ###
Contains multiple Kalman filter implementations (Python), as well as the links to the paper/website they were adapted from.
**Currently working on: Kalman Filter 4**

### Kalman Filter - Matlab ###
Contains an unfinished Kalman filter implemented in Matlab. We will not be using or developing this implementation any further.
